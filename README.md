RobotSensorLibrary
==================

A library that allows for easy interfacing with the robot sensors.

## Functions

- `void initializeADC10()`
	-Sets up the ADC10 registers appropriately for use with the robot sensors.

- 'unsigned int checkLeftSensor()'
	-Returns the voltage found at the left sensor after configuring the left sensor.

- 'unsigned int checkRightSensor()'
	=Returns the voltage found at the right sensor after configuring the right sensor.

- This library also contains interrupt code for ADC10.
										## Example Code
										```c

//This code would initialize the ADC10 register and then return the left sensor voltage.
									        initializeADC10();
int voltageAtLeftSensor = checkLeftSensor();
										```
